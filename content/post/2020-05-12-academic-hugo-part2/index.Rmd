This is in continuation to a post I wrote - [Academic Hugo Theme via Blogdown: Where to start?](https://arorarshi.rbind.io/post/2020-04-24-academic-hugo-tutorial.html) 

After setting up a basic website with `About`, `Skills` and `Experience` pages. You are now ready to deploy it and implement some cool customization! 

# Deployment 

I am deploying my site, the one you are reading this post on :), on __Netlify__ and then using a free subdomain with [`rbind.io`](https://github.com/rbind/support). 

## What's the difference?  

Generally you need to buy a domain to host web pages, but with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) you can use their web hosting service, with their domain and be live on the internet! It is free, however you can choose your own subdomain. 

Setting up on __Netlify__ is super easy - 

* log in to Netlify via GitHub and select the repository where you have all the website files
    + Netlify deployment works on both private and public repositories

* Set up the `HUGO_VERSION` accordingly. Check the version you are using in Rstudio via `blogdown::hugo_version()` command.

* Once you deploy, Netlify will assign a random subdomain ending in `netlify.app` or `netlify.com`, for instance I got `infallible-poitras-1234-netlify.app`

* The __IMPORTANT__ bit, after you have deployed your website on Netlify, change the `baseurl` parameter in `config.toml` 

* You can change the subdomain and keep the `netlify.app`. Or you can apply for a `rbind.io` domain name.
    + Just open an issue on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rbind/support), and fill their template form. They are quick and will get back to you soon! 

Now, everytime you commit to GitHub, Netlify will trigger a deploy. However, you can change this automatic trigger. __ALSO__, remember to run `blogdown::build_site()` before each commit, as this updates the `public` folder, which is used by Netlify to publish. 

For step by step instructions to Netlify, check this post [here](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/)

## Redirects

To redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPs, use a redirects file. I placed a file called `_redirects` here - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
static
  |=== _redirects 
```

It contains this - 

> http://arorarshi.rbind.io/*     https://arorarshi.rbind.io/:splat  301!

Also explained [here](https://yihui.org/en/2017/11/301-redirect/)

Now moving on to the cool stuff with customization!ðŸ˜Ž

# Customizations

## Favicon
A `favicon` is a website icon or a tab icon on the left hand side in a tab. For example mine is a sun :). To get one for yourself, just select `favicon` image of your choice and place it here - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
assets
  |=== images 
    |=== filename.png
```


## Color and Fonts
Academic template is really good and it already comes with great inbuilt [themes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/themes/) like - _Apogee, Minimal, Forest, Rose_ etc. Themes can be specified here  - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
config
  |=== params.toml 
```

with the variable `theme`

If you want to create your own color and font template, use any of the the existing themes and open the file here - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
themes
  |=== hugo-academic 
    |=== data
      |=== themes 
```

Each theme has its own `.toml` file. 

The colors are specified as `HTML` codes for `Primary`, `Menu` sections and so on. I used [this](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) to pick colors! 

Towards the end of the `.toml` file, there will be a `font` parameter. 
Font `.toml` files are present here -

```{r, eval=FALSE}
themes
  |=== hugo-academic 
    |=== data
      |=== fonts 
```
I used Google fonts and you can specify them as they appear in their web address. Check out other `.toml` files to get a hang of it! 

As always __Rinse and Repeat__ Or restart the R session and `blogdown::build_site()`.
