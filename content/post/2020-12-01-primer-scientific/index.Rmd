As I finished writing the final draft of my first first author paper, [survClust](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.084798v1), there were a lot of other firsts! In my opinion writing the methods and a crisp conclusion and discussion  were the difficult parts. 

Below, I share my notes that really came in handy while I was writing the methods section of my manuscript. 

## What this is?  

Notes on how to describe a statistical methodology. Some basic rules and notations that you should keep in mind. 

## Scientific notations

* Random variables are usually written in uppercase roman letters: $X,Y$, etc.

* Probability density functions (pdfs) and probability mass functions are denoted by lowercase letters, e.g. $f_{(x)}$, or $f_{X}(x)$.

* Cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) are denoted by uppercase letters, e.g. $F(x)$, or $F_{X}(x)$.

Let's summarize the above three points with an example - 

A random variable $X$ has density $f_{X}$ as follows - 

$$ Pr[a\leq X\leq b]=\int _{a}^{b}f_{X}(x)\,dx$$

Hence, if $F_{X}$ is the cumulative distribution function of $X$ then:

$$F_{X}(x)=\int _{-\infty }^{x}f_{X}(u)\,du,$$

and 

$$f_{X}(x)={\frac {d}{dx}}F_{X}(x).$$

Now, let's go over some quick statistical nitty-gritties: 

* Greek letters $\theta, \beta$ are commonly used to denote unknown parameters.

* Placing a hat, or caret, over a true parameter denotes an estimator of it, e.g., $\widehat {\theta }$ is an estimator for $\theta$ .

* Building on the above point the __sample__ mean, variance and correlation coefficient are denoted as $\bar{x}, s^2, r$ respectively. On the other hand __population__ parameters are represented as follows - population mean $\mu$, population variance $\sigma^2$, and population correlation as $\rho$

__Finally most of the time you will need to know the following writing notions while drafting the methods section of your manuscript__ - 

* Input or independent variables are denoted by $X$, output or dependent variables are denoted by $Y$, and qualitative outputs by $G$. 

* If $X$ is a vector, annotate its values by subscripts $X_j$

* Observed values are written in lowercase; hence the $i^{th}$ observed value of $X$ is written as $x_i$, where $x_i$ is  a scalar or vector. 

* Matrices are represented by bold uppercase letters; for example a matrix $\textbf{X}$, with dimensions $N$ x $p$ i.e a set of $N$ input $p$-vectors. In general, vectors will not be bold, except when they have $N$ components; Note that all vectors are assumed to be column vectors.

Let's break it down with an example - 

Given a vector of inputs $\textbf{X}^T = (X_1,X_2,...,X_p)$, we predict the output $\textbf{Y}$ via a simple linear regression - 

$$\hat{\textbf{Y}} = \hat\beta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{p} \textbf{X}_{j}\hat\beta_{j}$$
Or writing this in a vector form as an inner product - $\hat{\textbf{Y}} = \textbf{X}^T\hat\beta$
To solve this we need to estimate a value of {\beta} such that it minimizes the Residual Sum of Squares or RSS as follows - 

$$RSS(\beta) =  \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - x_{i}^T\beta)^2$$

Or in matrix notation we can write it as, 

$$RSS(\beta) =  (\textbf{y} - \textbf{X}\beta)^T(\textbf{y} - \textbf{X}\beta)$$
where $\textbf{X}$ is an $N Ã— p$ matrix with each row an input vector, and $\textbf{y}$ is an $N$-vector of the outputs. See how $\textbf{y}$ is in bold in the above question. 

Or take one of your favorite papers, and try to go over its methods section to iron and figure out other key details!
