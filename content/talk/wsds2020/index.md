Analysis of clusters in a population is one of the ways to understand the heterogeneity within a cohort. We introduce, panelmap, a data visualization tool for viewing grouped data and its differentiated features in a single and multi-panel layout. panelmap t is a visual aid for understanding associations and trends in data at a glance instead of tabular representation or trying to infer multiple plots. It provides rich source of functions to annotate, perform statistical tests and other descriptive summaries to understand distribution of features across clusters. It can automate legend, annotate missingness and allows various customizations to the user for generating rich and publication quality visualizations. 
A multi-panel layout function, circomap, for more than one cohort is also available. circomap, arranges more than one panelmaps in a circular layout, conveying information across various datasets.
panelmap is written in R and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/arorarshi/panelmap
