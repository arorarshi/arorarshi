  Responsibilities include:
  
  *  Developing a semi-supervised classification algorithm that maximizes survival differences in molecularly profiled cohorts on various platforms. This is implemented through a weighted clustering model, utilizing multidimensional scaling. Classification groups are deemed robust via cross-validation.
  *  Providing genomics and analytical support to faculty members of Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on a broad range of analysis like copy number and clonal evolution, mutational signature analysis, and building statistical models to identify prognostic molecular features in exome sequencing and mutation panel testing datasets.
