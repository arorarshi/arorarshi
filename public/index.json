You are now ready to deploy it and implement some cool customization!\nDeployment I am deploying my site, the one you are reading this post on :), on Netlify and then using a free subdomain with rbind.io.\nWhatâ€™s the difference? Generally you need to buy a domain to host web pages, but with Netlify you can use their web hosting service, with their domain and be live on the internet! It is free, however you can choose your own subdomain.\nSetting up on Netlify is super easy -\n log in to Netlify via GitHub and select the repository where you have all the website files  Netlify deployment works on both private and public repositories  Set up the HUGO_VERSION accordingly. Check the version you are using in Rstudio via blogdown::hugo_version() command.\n Once you deploy, Netlify will assign a random subdomain ending in netlify.app or netlify.com, for instance I got infallible-poitras-1234-netlify.app\n The IMPORTANT bit, after you have deployed your website on Netlify, change the baseurl parameter in config.toml\n You can change the subdomain and keep the netlify.app. Or you can apply for a rbind.io domain name.  Just open an issue on their GitHub repository, and fill their template form. They are quick and will get back to you soon!   Now, everytime you commit to GitHub, Netlify will trigger a deploy. However, you can change this automatic trigger. ALSO, remember to run blogdown::build_site() before each commit, as this updates the public folder, which is used by Netlify to publish.\nPsst.. what do you mean by domain and subdomain\n  Redirects To redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPs, use a redirects file. I placed a file called _redirects here -\nstatic |=== _redirects  It contains this -\n http://arorarshi.rbind.io/* https://arorarshi.rbind.io/:splat 301!\n Also explained here\nNow moving on to the cool stuff with customization!ðŸ˜Ž\n  Customizations Favicon A favicon is a website icon or a tab icon on the left hand side in a tab. For example mine is a sun :). To get one for yourself, just select favicon image of your choice and place it here -\nassets |=== images |=== filename.png  Color and Fonts Academic template is really good and it already comes with great inbuilt themes like - Apogee, Minimal, Forest, Rose etc. Themes can be specified here -\nconfig |=== params.toml  with the variable theme\nIf you want to create your own color and font template, use any of the the existing themes and open the file here -\nthemes |=== hugo-academic |=== data |=== themes  Each theme has its own .toml file.\nThe colors are specified as HTML codes for Primary, Menu sections and so on. I used this to pick colors!\nTowards the end of the .toml file, there will be a font parameter. Font .toml files are present here -\nthemes |=== hugo-academic |=== data |=== fonts  I used Google fonts and you can specify them as they appear in their web address. Check out other .toml files to get a hang of it!\n  References 1.https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/ 2. https://getemoji.com/\n ","date":1589241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589241600,"objectID":"59bc50da5529ceead5431d1e37e4e2e4","permalink":"/post/2020-05-12-academic-hugo-part2.html","publishdate":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-05-12-academic-hugo-part2.html","section":"post","summary":"This is in continuation to a post I wrote - Academic Hugo Theme via Blogdown: Where to start?\nAfter setting up a basic website with About, Skills and Experience pages.","tags":["tutorial"],"title":"Academic Hugo Theme via Blogdown: Few more details and deployment (part 2)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R studio"],"content":" Setting up a personal website is fun and a great way to reach visibility. Whether its your work, skills, or other hobbies, they all can reach the light of day in one platform!\nI will go over building websites via blogdown with Hugoâ€™s Acadmeic theme as a template. Though Yihuiâ€™s blogdown tutorial is the ultimate Holy Grail. I wanted to write a simple tutorial about getting started with a quick and easy website without getting overwhelmed :)\n0. Getting Started By running the following commands in R:\n#set up install.packages(\u0026#39;blogdown\u0026#39;) library(\u0026quot;blogdown\u0026quot;) blogdown::install_hugo() #start creating a website by new_site()! blogdown::new_site(theme = \u0026quot;gcushen/hugo-academic\u0026quot;) #I have passed the academic theme above #view your website locally blogdown::build_site() OK. This created a bunch of files in your directory, and created a static website, something like this\nThis is an exhaustive overview of how the Academic template looks like. We donâ€™t need all of these functionalities, and we can only retain what we like.\nIf you mess up something, original GitHub code is available here for your reference.\n 1. Whatâ€™s going on? A lot!\nFirst place I would recommend trying is getting familiar with .md files present here your website folder \u0026gt; content \u0026gt; home\nWe are looking at this\n Each .md file here is a functionality/widget of the Academic theme. For example, if you see the skills section of the website has icons in rows, experience section is in a bullet-timeline format, and so on. They are all controlled by the files here, and are displayed by logical active=true/false as follows-\n# About widget. widget = \u0026quot;about\u0026quot; # See https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/ headless = true # This file represents a page section. active = true # Activate this widget? true/false # If active=FALSE widget is suppressed and displayed if TRUE. Start by turning everything FALSE except -\n about.md skills.md experience.md  Also, note the weight section in the .md script. This is the order in which widgets will get displayed on your website. For example, the bubbles image background at the very top has weight=1 as seen in slider.md.\n 2. Getting the hang of it? After turning off all the widgets, except about.md, skills.md and experience.md (you donâ€™t have to delete others, and might want to store them for later). You will have the bare bones of your website.\nNow start filling in some details. The about.md file points to content -\u0026gt; authors -\u0026gt; admin -\u0026gt; _index.md file, from where it stores and displays all that information. Fill it up with your own deets!\nSame goes for skills.md and eperience.md\n 3. config.toml and config folder I use config.toml for all my settings, and as the name says config details. Remaining stuff like menu details go to config -\u0026gt; _default -\u0026gt; menus.toml, and params.toml for all website settings like theme, color, and other settings. (You wonâ€™t need a lot to start with)\nmenus.toml This is the easy part! This just contains the menu buttons you want to see at the top of your website. Though everything is published on your website in a long-ish format. Here, the menu buttons at the top will help the viewer to navigate to key sections. Use the widgets you want to appear here like follows:\n[[main]] name = \u0026quot;Projects\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#projects\u0026quot; weight = 30 [[main]] name = \u0026quot;Posts\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#posts\u0026quot; weight = 40 # and so on In my website about and skills are at weight 10 and 20, and thatâ€™s why projects has weight 30. Menu items follow the same order and weights as the widgets as well. You can change that! Weights just determine the order of appearance in the menu section.\n config.toml Here, I have everything as default except-\nbaseurl = \u0026quot;https://arorarshi.rbind.io/\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;Arshi Arora\u0026quot; copyright = paginate = 10 # Number of items per page in paginated lists. enableEmoji = true sharing = true #fixing image in posts #this just puts the image used in your rmarkdown posts to appropriate folder, so that it doesn\u0026#39;t appear broken on website. confused? you can skip for now. uglyurls = true #[permalinks] # post = \u0026quot;/:year/:month/:day/:slug/\u0026quot; [blackfriday] bit #this is only needed for .md files. Pandoc is better for .Rmd. Maybe remove later but for now I have it in.   params.toml For a basic setup, you donâ€™t need to worry about this.\n  4. Rinse and Repeat Keep adding interesting details about yourself and playing around with the widgets. I will add deployment and other intricate details in the next post!\n References https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/   ","date":1587686400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587686400,"objectID":"03672119c2993c810beb26c4e3bac5ef","permalink":"/post/2020-04-24-academic-hugo-tutorial.html","publishdate":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-04-24-academic-hugo-tutorial.html","section":"post","summary":"Setting up a personal website is fun and a great way to reach visibility.
